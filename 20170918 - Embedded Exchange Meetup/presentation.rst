Outline:

* Who am I?

* Obligatory what is IoT? (less about IoT and more about Types of IoT)

* Three types of IoT: Residential, Commercial, Industrial

* Residential IoT

  * Gimics and Gadgets

* Industrial IoT

  * New name for the things we've been doing for years

  * SCADA

* Commercial IoT

  * This is where the magic is happening

  * Future is systems and integrations, Islands are less than useless

  * All about solving problems

    * Reducing recurring operational costs

    * Making tenants more confortable

    * Monitoring the building for maintenance and security issues

  * Data is effectively useless, people want information

    * Simpleton's definitions of data vs information

    * Most people can't interpret sensor data

    * People want information that can be acted upon (e.g. adjust the temperatur to save a buck on the heating bill)

  * Integrations, bring different datas together to synthesize more insightful informations

    * Insert joke about marketing wank

    * Insert picture of Data and Lore

  * Sensor through network to gateway to cloud to user of data

    * Humans

    * M2M

    * Proprietary vs Open Sources Networks

    * Local vs WAN

  * Local analysis and response is essential

    * Internet round trip make cloud take too long

    * Relying on internet/WAN technologies adds unneeded dependencies

    * Cloud good for logging, supplimental data and analysis

    * WAN connections OK for supplimental sensors

  * Conclusions

    * IoT isn't going away.  It's just part of the internet.

    * Information synthesis is critical.

    * Interactions with other data sources is critical.

    * Bringing all of it together to for a system is the key.

* Questions?

  * I probably don't have the answers.

The Future of Embedded Systems and IoT in Smart Communities and Buildings
=========================================================================

  This is the title slide.  Smile.

.. note::

  * I have a bit of a jaded view.

  * I work for a company that has been doing these kinds of things for 30+ years.

  * I've even tried making some of my own IoT wizbangs

    * Truth be told, still trying

Obligatory: What is IoT?
========================

The Internet of things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical devices, vehicles (also referred to as "connected
devices" and "smart devices"), buildings, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and
network connectivity which enable these objects to collect and exchange data.

  * This is the internet, ladies and gentlemen

:id: types-of-iot

Types of IoT
============

* Residential

* Commercial

* Industrial

.. note::

  * There's a ton of overlap between these types.

----

:id: residential-iot

Residential IoT
===============

* Gimmicks

  * Padlocks & Bike locks

  * Tracking tags

  * Light switches

* Marketing

  * Alexa & Google Home

* DIY / Open Source

  * Too many to list

.. note::

  * Most of these devices have limited use.

  * There are systems like Iris and Samsung, but they try to force vendor lock-in and are still gimmicky

  * We'll touch on technical issues later in the presentation

    * similar to commercial IoT

----

:id: industrial-iot

Industial IoT
=============

* Already been done.

* Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)

* Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs)
